# MachineLearning
Introduction to Machine Learning Models with Python.

The following contains a list of all codes along with sample datasets(curtosy:kaggle) that you will require to build models in Python. 

## The list of contents are as follow:

**1. Data Pre-Processing**

**2. Regression Models**
- Simple Linear Regression 
- Multiple Linear Regression 
- Polynomial Regression 
- Support vector Machine(SVM) Regression 
- Decision Tree Regression 
- Random Forest Regression 

**3. Classification Models**
- Logistic Regression 
- K-Nearest Neighbors 
- Support Vector Machine 
- Kernel SVM 
- Naive Bayes 
- Decision Tree Classification 
- Random Forest Classification 

**4. Clustering**
- K-Means cLUSTERING 
- Hierarchical Clustering 

**5. Assoication Rule Learning**
- Apriori 
- Eclat 

**6. Reinforcement Learning**
- Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
- Thompson Sampling 

**7. Natural Language Processing**

**8. Deep Learning**
- Artificial Neural Networks 
- Convolutional Neural Networks 

**9. Dimensionality Reduction**
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Kernel PCA

**10. Model Selection & Boosting**
- (XGBoost)

PS: By convention, in all the files, the dependent variable 'y' is taken to be in the **1st Column** and the only change you will need to make is with teh name of your file( in place of **Enter_the_name_of_your_file.csv**)
